//Usage of cocoa pods and third party libraries is fine
//Enter a username or tumblr url to load a user's feed
//Display feed items for all posts
//Feed should be infinitely scrollable collection view supporting a way to refresh
//If the post originated from another user, I should be able to tap another users avatar/user to transition to that users feed using a custom navigation transition
//Full HTML rendering of posts (without web view)
//Client side persistence for using core data
//App should properly update when coming in and out of active states
//App should be resilient to loss of network connectivity where possible
//Unit tests are encouraged
//Use of animations are encouraged
//All code should be in Github

// 1 type in username into tumblr api to get a response

// 2 build ui
